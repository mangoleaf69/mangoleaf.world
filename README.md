###  Path to value.  
 - First create value and then profit will come.
 - Start with a strong MVP.  This will allow people to see your vision.
 - Get social feedback from friends, family and strangers. 
 - Don't be afraid of change and pivots.  The technology is there let people tell you 			how they want to use itâ€¦

### Feedback to date: 
- Feedback from Minjee: I want to put pictures of my farm so work-a-wayers can see what it looks like before they arrive.
- Feedback from Drew:  How do I see the map I want to see what you have been doing.

### Ideas for Profit. 
    Like the public app. host it internaly for your team / organization
    ... We can create a self hostable re-brandable version with enterprise features.
    ... For 500$/ month we can host this for you with support and SLA etc.

    Want to promote your buisnes for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50$ per month get featred photos that show on top of results in your location.
    ... Start free and post. then bid on your location to have your photo show on top.
